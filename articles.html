      <h1>Cleveland Browns Season Outlook</h1>
  <p>
    Despite making multiple moves in the offseason to make the team better the Cleveland Browns find themselves 1-4 through this season. With many betting experts predicting them to finish last in the league, it is starting to seem like the Browns will be taking a quarterback in next years draft once again, after drafting two this past year in Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. This week aganist the Pittsburgh Steelers the Browns will once again be using a rookie quarterback after trading veteran Joe Flacco to the Cincinnati Bengals who are also struggling at the quarterback position.
  </p>
 

  
  <h2>Predictions on the Browns Season</h2>
  <p>
    The upcoming schedule Browns gets easier as the season goes on, so it is far from over this year and there is still a chance for the Browns to win their division but it starts off this week with the game aganist the Steelers. If the Browns can get a win and start stringing wins together this season could end up being a success after a slow start, but depending on two rookie quarterbacks it could be a long shot.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Browns could end up getting a very good draft pick in next years draft, but my prediction on their season would have them ending the season with a 5-12 record, netting them one of the worst records and obtaining a top 3 pick in next years draft where they will probably draft another quarterback.
